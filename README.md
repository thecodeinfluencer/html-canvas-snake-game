# HTML Canvas Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML canvas and JavaScript. The game consists of a snake that moves around the canvas and tries to eat food that appears randomly. The player controls the direction of the snake using arrow keys on the keyboard. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or with its own body.

## How to Play

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
